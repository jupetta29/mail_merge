# Mail Merge
> Save some hassle in sending out letters

Let's say the user needs to send out lots of letters. Maybe for a birthday party,  wedding invites, or  to email clients. This program will personalize the part of that file that says for example, "Dear John" to a name that's in a list of names the user creates.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get Mail Merge up &
running.

```shell
# N/A
```

At this time, there are no modules/packages needed for installation to get started.
